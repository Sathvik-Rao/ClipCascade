**Important Note:** Since the application is not published or registered with Microsoft, you may see a warning suggesting that it could be unsafe. This is a standard precaution and does not indicate any issues with the software. You can choose to ignore this warning or temporarily disable your antivirus during installation. All source code is available in this repository, and everything is open source and free. If you prefer, you can compile the executable yourself. Feel free to review the code to ensure your comfort! **Registering the application with Microsoft requires purchasing a certificate subscription, which is quite expensive, especially for an open-source project.**

The `.exe` file does not need UAC approval because it is standalone executable, while the `.msi` installer will request UAC permissions because it creates a designated folder for the software, adds a startup option, and allows for uninstallation via the Control Panel. Additionally, with the .msi installer, you have the option to choose any location to save the software. However, select locations where even when you create a file manually at that location, Windows shouldn’t prompt for permission to answer "yes or no" questions.


### 🍏 macOS Desktop Application:

To install the macOS desktop application, download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade/releases).

1. **Download** the appropriate version:

#### Android Automatic Clipboard Monitoring Setup:

To enable automatic clipboard monitoring on both rooted and non-rooted devices, execute the following three ADB commands.

##### Install ADB

Before proceeding, make sure ADB is installed on your system. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) to install ADB on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

##### ADB Commands

1. **Enable the `READ_LOGS` permission:**
   ```bash
   adb -d shell pm grant com.clipcascade android.permission.READ_LOGS
   ```

2. **Allow "Display/Drawing over other apps," "Screen overlay," or "Appear on top":**
   This permission can also be enabled from the device's Settings. To set it via ADB, use:
   ```bash
   adb -d shell appops set com.clipcascade SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW allow
   ```

3. **Kill the app for the new permissions to take effect:**
   ```bash
   adb -d shell am force-stop com.clipcascade
   ```
![adb commands](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3faa8d71-d099-48d5-9846-4683cf77f285)

> Once the setup is complete, it operates seamlessly without requiring any extra steps. It monitors log entries related to ClipCascade, and if it detects an error during a clipboard copy action, it will trigger an overlay window to gain focus. This overlay allows the app to capture the clipboard content and send it to the server immediately before going out of focus and closing. When the app is uninstalled, these permissions will be removed, requiring you to redo these steps. Additionally, each time you start the foreground service, it will prompt you to choose whether to monitor logs. This ensures that everything remains secure and under your control.

After executing three ADB commands, when you click the **Start** button, you will see a pop-up message. Click **"Allow."**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3649d7-1e57-448c-ade9-10641191402d" alt="allow_log_monitoring" width="250" />


### 🐧🖱️ Linux Desktop Application (GUI) / 🐧⌨️ Linux Terminal-Based Application (non-GUI):

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install ClipCascade on Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch-based systems. While the commands are specifically tailored for these distributions, you can adapt the process for other Linux distributions with minor modifications. The Linux code is available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade/releases) as `ClipCascade_Linux.zip`. Once downloaded, navigate to the `ClipCascade/` folder containing `main.py`, and open a terminal in that directory.
> **Note:** Linux systems use different display servers, primarily `X11` and `Wayland`. `Wayland` can also include `XWayland`, which supports `X` sessions. The program automatically detects the display server and selects the appropriate interface, either **GUI** or **CLI**, based on the environment.

#### Step 1: Check for updates and install required packages

##### Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-gi xclip wl-clipboard dunst

```

##### Arch:
```
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python3.*/site-packages/Cryptodome /usr/lib/python3.*/site-packages/Crypto
```

#### Step 4.2: Fix 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named `tkinter`' Error (if applicable)

If you encounter the `No module named 'tkinter'` error:

##### Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install -y python3-tkinter
```

##### Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install -y python3-tkinter
```

##### Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm tk
```

#### Step 4.3:  Fix '`gtk_widget_get_scale_factor: assertion 'GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed`' Error (if applicable)

This error occurs due to a missing tray icon extension in GNOME. To resolve it, you can install the extension from [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support)


#### Step 4.4:  Fix '`g-exec-error-quark`' Error (if applicable)

##### Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install dbus-x11
```

##### Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install dbus-x11
```

##### Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm dbus
```

#### Step 6: Run the Application in the Background (if needed)

To run ClipCascade as a background process (if the GUI setup is functional), use the following command:
```
nohup python3 main.py &> /dev/null &
```
If root privileges are required, use:
```
sudo nohup python3 main.py &> /dev/null &
```


#### Step 7: Add ClipCascade to Startup Script (if needed)

To ensure ClipCascade starts automatically when your system boots, modify the file paths as necessary and add the appropriate command to your startup script.

##### Example:
##### GUI
```
cd /path/to/clipcascade/src/ && nohup python3 main.py &> /dev/null &
```
If root privileges are required, use:
```
cd /path/to/clipcascade/src/ && sudo nohup python3 main.py &> /dev/null &
```

##### non-GUI
```
cd /path/to/clipcascade/src/ && python3 main.py
```
If root privileges are required, use:
```
cd /path/to/clipcascade/src/ && sudo python3 main.py
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Details

### Windows and Linux:
- Logs (`clipcascade_log.log`) are present in the installed path, allowing you to review application activity. These logs reset upon reopening the application, so they don’t grow indefinitely.
- You can customize advanced settings in the **DATA** file, which is also located in the installed path. This file is generated only after your first login and remains there indefinitely.
- On Linux, you will see a `ClipCascade.lock` file while the program is running. This file prevents the user from opening multiple instances of ClipCascade.

### macOS
- Program files are located in `<current user>/Library/Application Support/ClipCascade/`. To open it, click **Program Files**.
  
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b78e3f7-0bb0-4e64-9752-2834f3d792e1" alt="macOS Program Files" width="140" />  
- **Logs** (`clipcascade_log.log`): Review application activity. These logs reset upon reopening the application to prevent them from growing indefinitely.
- You can customize advanced settings in the **DATA** file. This file is generated only after your first login and remains there indefinitely.
- You will see a `ClipCascade.lock` file while the program is running. This file prevents the user from opening multiple instances of ClipCascade.

### Android:
- You can configure advanced settings on the login page by clicking **Enable Extra Config**. 
  - The main options include:
    - **Store Password Locally:** Enable this option if you are frequently getting logged out. The app stores the session cookie for an extended period, but due to the variety of devices used worldwide, exceptions may occur. This option can be very useful.
    - **Maximum Clipboard Size Local Limit:** If the app crashes or stops unexpectedly, it means it received a clipboard size greater than the platform's maximum limit. You can specify a local size limit by typing in the size in bytes (e.g., 512 KiB = 524288 bytes) to test different limits that work for your device. This local limit is in addition to the server-specified limit, ensuring smoother operation without crashes.
    - **Run on System Startup:** Enable this option to allow the app to automatically start on system reboot. By default, this option is disabled. If you are using the [ADB](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade?tab=readme-ov-file#adb-commands) workaround, keep this option disabled to avoid issues with the READ_LOGS permission [popup](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade?tab=readme-ov-file#adb-commands) being dismissed, which prevents clipboard monitoring in the background.

### End-to-End Encryption Configuration for Clipboard Data:

When encryption is enabled, the clipboard data is encrypted on client devices. The server does not store this key, ensuring end-to-end encryption. The encryption password is generated using the user’s password, a salt, and the number of rounds, allowing you to control the **salt** and **number of rounds** used. This process creates a unique hashed password based on the specified salt and number of rounds.

However, it is crucial to use the same salt and number of rounds across all client devices. The default number of hash rounds is set to **664,937**, referred to as `hash_rounds`, while the default salt is set to empty, referred to as `salt`.

In the desktop application, you can find these fields in the **DATA** file located in the software's directory. On mobile devices, you can adjust these settings on the login page under **extra config**.

Before making any changes, ensure you log out and exit the application. After editing the `hash_rounds` or `salt` fields, log back in for the changes to take effect.
