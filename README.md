1. **Download** the installer from the Releases page.
2. **Run** the installer and follow the on-screen instructions, and select the default installation path specified by the installer.
   - Startup is enabled by default; you can disable it in the Task Manager if desired.

   - When prompted for the server connection, use the server IP and port, appending `/clipsocket` for the WebSocket connection (e.g., `ws://<server_ip>:<server_port>/clipsocket`).
   - If encryption is enabled, please ensure it is enabled on all devices.


**Important Note:** Since the application is not published or registered with Microsoft, you may see a warning suggesting that it could be unsafe. This is a standard precaution and does not indicate any issues with the software. You can choose to ignore this warning or temporarily disable your antivirus during installation. All source code is available in this repository, and everything is open source and free. If you prefer, you can compile the executable yourself. Feel free to review the code to ensure your comfort!

## ⚙️ Advanced Details

### Windows
- Logs are present in the installed path, allowing you to review application activity. These logs reset upon reopening the application, so they don’t grow indefinitely.
- You can customize advanced settings in the **DATA** file, which is also located in the installed path. This file is generated only after your first login and remains there indefinitely.

### Android
- You can configure advanced settings on the login page by clicking **Enable Extra Config**. 
  - The main options include:
    - **Store Password Locally:** Enable this option if you are frequently getting logged out. The app stores the session cookie for an extended period, but due to the variety of devices used worldwide, exceptions may occur. This option can be very useful.
    - **Maximum Clipboard Size Local Limit:** If the app crashes or stops unexpectedly, it means it received a clipboard size greater than the platform's maximum limit. You can specify a local size limit by typing in the size in bytes (e.g., 512 KiB = 524288 bytes) to test different limits that work for your device. This local limit is in addition to the server-specified limit, ensuring smoother operation without crashes.


## 🔧 Usage

1. **Login:** Use your credentials to log into ClipCascade.
2. **Sync:** Copy any text or content to your clipboard, and it will automatically sync across your connected devices.
3. **Monitor:** Open the web-based monitoring page to see your clipboard history in real-time.
