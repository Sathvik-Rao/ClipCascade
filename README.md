**Important Note:** Since the application is not published or registered with Microsoft, you may see a warning suggesting that it could be unsafe. This is a standard precaution and does not indicate any issues with the software. You can choose to ignore this warning or temporarily disable your antivirus during installation. All source code is available in this repository, and everything is open source and free. If you prefer, you can compile the executable yourself. Feel free to review the code to ensure your comfort! **Registering the application with Microsoft requires purchasing a certificate subscription, which is quite expensive, especially for an open-source project.**

The `.exe` file does not need UAC approval because it is standalone executable, while the `.msi` installer will request UAC permissions because it creates a designated folder for the software, adds a startup option, and allows for uninstallation via the Control Panel. Additionally, with the .msi installer, you have the option to choose any location to save the software. However, select locations where even when you create a file manually at that location, Windows shouldn’t prompt for permission to answer "yes or no" questions.


### 🍏 macOS Desktop Application:

To install the macOS desktop application, download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade/releases).

1. **Download** the appropriate version:

#### Android Automatic Clipboard Monitoring Setup:

To enable automatic clipboard monitoring on both rooted and non-rooted devices, execute the following three ADB commands.

##### Install ADB

Before proceeding, make sure ADB is installed on your system. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) to install ADB on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

##### ADB Commands

1. **Enable the `READ_LOGS` permission:**
   ```bash
   adb -d shell pm grant com.clipcascade android.permission.READ_LOGS
   ```

2. **Allow "Display/Drawing over other apps," "Screen overlay," or "Appear on top":**
   This permission can also be enabled from the device's Settings. To set it via ADB, use:
   ```bash
   adb -d shell appops set com.clipcascade SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW allow
   ```

3. **Kill the app for the new permissions to take effect:**
   ```bash
   adb -d shell am force-stop com.clipcascade
   ```
![adb commands](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3faa8d71-d099-48d5-9846-4683cf77f285)

> Once the setup is complete, it operates seamlessly without requiring any extra steps. It monitors log entries related to ClipCascade, and if it detects an error during a clipboard copy action, it will trigger an overlay window to gain focus. This overlay allows the app to capture the clipboard content and send it to the server immediately before going out of focus and closing. When the app is uninstalled, these permissions will be removed, requiring you to redo these steps. Additionally, each time you start the foreground service, it will prompt you to choose whether to monitor logs. This ensures that everything remains secure and under your control.

After executing three ADB commands, when you click the **Start** button, you will see a pop-up message. Click **"Allow."**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d3649d7-1e57-448c-ade9-10641191402d" alt="allow_log_monitoring" width="250" />


### 🐧🖱️ Linux Desktop Application (GUI) / 🐧⌨️ Linux Terminal-Based Application (CLI):

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install ClipCascade on Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch-based systems. While the commands are specifically tailored for these distributions, you can adapt the process for other Linux distributions with minor modifications. The Linux code is available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade/releases) as `ClipCascade_Linux.zip`. Once downloaded, navigate to the `ClipCascade/` folder containing `main.py`, and open a terminal in that directory.
> **Note:** Linux systems use different display servers, primarily `X11` and `Wayland`. `Wayland` can also include `XWayland`, which supports `X` sessions. The program automatically detects the display server and selects the appropriate interface, either **GUI** or **CLI**, based on the environment.

```

#### Step 6: Run the Application in the Background (if needed)

To run ClipCascade as a background process (if the GUI setup is functional), use the following command:
```
nohup python3 main.py &> /dev/null &
```
If root privileges are required, use:
```
sudo nohup python3 main.py &> /dev/null &
```


#### Step 7: Add ClipCascade to Startup Script (if needed)

To ensure ClipCascade starts automatically when your system boots, modify the file paths as necessary and add the appropriate command to your startup script.

##### Example:

## ⚙️ Advanced Details

- Logs (`clipcascade_log.log`) are stored in the installation directory on Windows and Linux, and in `<current user>/Library/Application Support/ClipCascade/` on macOS. These logs allow you to review application activity and are automatically reset each time the application is reopened, preventing indefinite growth.
- On Linux and macOS, a `ClipCascade.lock` file is created while the program is running. This file ensures that only a single instance of ClipCascade can be opened at a time.
- The `DATA` file stores settings and user details, enabling the app to retain this information across both restarts and updates.

### Extra Config (Desktop/Mobile):
- **Maximum Clipboard Size Local Limit (in bytes)**: If the app crashes or stops unexpectedly, it may be due to receiving clipboard content exceeding the platform's maximum size limit. You can set a local size limit by specifying a value in bytes (e.g., 512 KiB = 524288 bytes) to test different thresholds suitable for your device. This local limit works alongside the server-specified limit to ensure smoother operation without crashes. For example, on Android (particularly on the Pixel 6a as of 2024), the platform limit(for text) is typically less than 1 MiB. Since the server limit cannot go below 1 MiB, setting the local limit to around 900,000 bytes on the Pixel 6a can help prevent crashes.
- **Store Password Locally (not recommended)**: Enable this option if you frequently encounter session logouts. While the app stores session cookies for an extended period, a server restart may prompt a re-login. If re-entering the password becomes tedious, you can use this option to store your password locally for convenience.
- **Enable Image Sharing and Enable File Sharing**: Enabling these options allows the app to send images or files. However, the app will continue to receive images and files even if these options are disabled.
- **Enable Notification**: Turn on this option to receive notifications about WebSocket disconnections and reconnections.
- **Enable Encryption (recommended)**: Enabling this option activates end-to-end encryption for clipboard data. This ensures that all clipboard content is encrypted before leaving your device. Refer to the section below on E2E encryption for detailed instructions on how it works and how to configure the `salt` and `hash rounds`.

  ### Android (Specific):
  - **Run on System Startup**: Enable this option to allow the app to automatically start on system reboot. By default, this option is disabled. If you are using the [ADB](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade?tab=readme-ov-file#adb-commands) workaround, keep this option disabled to avoid issues with the READ_LOGS permission [popup](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade?tab=readme-ov-file#adb-commands) being dismissed, which prevents clipboard monitoring in the background.
  - **Enable Periodic Checks**: Enabling this option performs periodic checks to ensure clipboard monitoring and the foreground service are running. It verifies the service status when monitoring starts and then checks every 15 minutes in the background. If the service is not running, a notification is displayed. Clicking the notification will restart the service.

### End-to-End Encryption Configuration for Clipboard Data:
When encryption is enabled, clipboard data is encrypted directly on the client devices. The server does not store the encryption key, ensuring true end-to-end encryption. The encryption password is derived from the user’s password, combined with a **salt** and the number of **hash rounds**, allowing you to configure these settings:

- **Hash Rounds**: An integer value specifying the number of hashing iterations.  
- **Salt**: Any string value used as an additional input for the hashing process.

It is essential to use the same **salt** and **hash rounds** across all client devices to maintain compatibility. By default:  
- **Hash Rounds**: 664,937  
- **Salt**: (Empty string)  

You can adjust these fields on the login page under the **Extra Config** section.

### Clipboard Functioning
- **Text and Images**: These are directly copied to the clipboard, enabling seamless sharing across devices.  
- **Files**: When files are received, a notification icon appears in the system tray (on desktop platforms). Since the clipboard does not store files, only their file paths are retained.

   | **Platform**              | **Implementation Details**                                                                                                                                              |
   |---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Windows**               | Uses `win32gui`, `win32api`, `win32con`, and `win32clipboard` to capture clipboard changes in an event-driven manner.                                         |
   | **macOS**                 | Utilizes the `pasteboard` to monitor the clipboard with polling every 0.3 seconds. Instead of checking clipboard content directly, it compares a counter to detect changes efficiently. |
   | **Linux (X11)**           | Employs `Gtk.Clipboard` to capture clipboard changes in an event-driven manner, running in GUI mode.                                                         |
   | **Linux (XWayland, Unknown)** | Switches between `Gtk.Clipboard` (event-based) or `x-clip` (polling every 0.3 seconds) depending on permissions (requires sudo for `Gtk.Clipboard`). Both operate in GUI mode. |
   | **Linux (Wayland, Hyprland)** | Uses `wl-clipboard` with polling every 5 seconds in CLI mode. The delay accounts for Wayland's requirement to focus a window to grab clipboard content, ensuring smoother OS interaction. |
   | **Android**               | Leverages `ClipboardManager` to capture clipboard changes in an event-driven manner.                                                                         |

## ⇄ Reverse Proxy Setup

Below is a screenshot demonstrating how to configure a reverse proxy using **Cloudflare Tunnels**. Similar configurations can be applied with other providers as well.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d6d000f-4516-47be-ae1d-8726dc4d6535" alt="Reverse Proxy" width="400" />

### Note:
For other providers, you may need to configure HTTP to HTTPS redirection manually by adding a permanent redirection rule.

Example: Caddy Configuration
```
http://clipcascade.sample.com {
	redir https://clipcascade.sample.com{uri} permanent
}
```
