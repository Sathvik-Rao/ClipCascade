> **Note:** [set up a reverse proxy, see here](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade?tab=readme-ov-file#-reverse-proxy-setup)

### ü¶æ Self-Hosted Server Bare Metal:

To host the ClipCascade server on any operating system where Java (17) can run, follow these steps:

1. **Download the JAR File**  
   Copy the `ClipCascade-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` from the [release page](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade/releases).

2. **Set Environment Variables**  
   Set the following environment variables in your OS:

   | Variable                      | Value              |
   |-------------------------------|--------------------|
   | `CC_USERNAME`                 | your-user-name     |

   > **Note:** [set up a reverse proxy, see here](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade?tab=readme-ov-file#-reverse-proxy-setup)


### ü™ü Windows Desktop Application:

To install the Windows desktop application, download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade/releases).

1. **Download** the installer from the Releases page.
2. **Run** the installer and follow the on-screen instructions, and select the default installation path specified by the installer.
   - Startup is enabled by default; you can disable it in the Task Manager if desired.
3. **Launch** ClipCascade and log in to start syncing your clipboard across devices.
   - When prompted for the server connection, use the server IP and port, appending `/clipsocket` for the WebSocket connection (e.g., `ws://<server_ip>:<server_port>/clipsocket`).
   - If encryption is enabled, please ensure it is enabled on all devices.


**Important Note:** Since the application is not published or registered with Microsoft, you may see a warning suggesting that it could be unsafe. This is a standard precaution and does not indicate any issues with the software. You can choose to ignore this warning or temporarily disable your antivirus during installation. All source code is available in this repository, and everything is open source and free. If you prefer, you can compile the executable yourself. Feel free to review the code to ensure your comfort!

The `.exe` file does not need UAC approval because it is standalone executable, while the `.msi` installer will request UAC permissions because it creates a designated folder for the software, adds a startup option, and allows for uninstallation via the Control Panel. Additionally, with the .msi installer, you have the option to choose any location to save the software. However, select locations where even when you create a file manually at that location, Windows shouldn‚Äôt prompt for permission to answer "yes or no" questions.


### ü§ñ Android Mobile Application:

To install the mobile application on your Android device, download the latest APK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Sathvik-Rao/ClipCascade/releases).

1. **Download** the APK from the Releases page.
2. **Enable** installation from unknown sources in your device settings, if prompted.
3. **Install** the APK by following the prompts on your device.
4. **Open** ClipCascade and log in to begin syncing your clipboard across devices.
   - When prompted for the server connection, use the server IP and port, appending `/clipsocket` for the WebSocket connection (e.g., `ws://<server_ip>:<server_port>/clipsocket`).
   - If encryption is enabled, please ensure it is enabled on all devices.

#### Android Automatic Clipboard Monitoring Setup:

To enable automatic clipboard monitoring on both rooted and non-rooted devices, execute the following three ADB commands.

##### Install ADB

Before proceeding, make sure ADB is installed on your system. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) to install ADB on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

##### ADB Commands

1. **Enable the `READ_LOGS` permission:**
   ```bash
   adb -d shell pm grant com.clipcascade android.permission.READ_LOGS
   ```

2. **Allow "Drawing over other apps":**
   This permission can also be enabled from the device's Settings. To set it via ADB, use:
   ```bash
   adb -d shell appops set com.clipcascade SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW allow
   ```

3. **Kill the app for the new permissions to take effect:**
   ```bash
   adb -d shell am force-stop com.clipcascade
   ```
![adb commands](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3faa8d71-d099-48d5-9846-4683cf77f285)

> Once the setup is complete, it operates seamlessly without requiring any extra steps. It monitors log entries related to ClipCascade, and if it detects an error during a clipboard copy action, it will trigger an overlay window to gain focus. This overlay allows the app to capture the clipboard content and send it to the server immediately before going out of focus and closing. When the app is uninstalled, these permissions will be removed, requiring you to redo these steps. Additionally, each time you start the foreground service, it will prompt you to choose whether to monitor logs. This ensures that everything remains secure and under your control.

After executing three ADB commands, when you click the **Start** button, you will see a pop-up message. Click **"Allow."**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Details

### Windows and Linux:
- Logs are present in the installed path, allowing you to review application activity. These logs reset upon reopening the application, so they don‚Äôt grow indefinitely.
- You can customize advanced settings in the **DATA** file, which is also located in the installed path. This file is generated only after your first login and remains there indefinitely.

### Android:
- You can configure advanced settings on the login page by clicking **Enable Extra Config**. 
  - The main options include:
    - **Store Password Locally:** Enable this option if you are frequently getting logged out. The app stores the session cookie for an extended period, but due to the variety of devices used worldwide, exceptions may occur. This option can be very useful.
    - **Maximum Clipboard Size Local Limit:** If the app crashes or stops unexpectedly, it means it received a clipboard size greater than the platform's maximum limit. You can specify a local size limit by typing in the size in bytes (e.g., 512 KiB = 524288 bytes) to test different limits that work for your device. This local limit is in addition to the server-specified limit, ensuring smoother operation without crashes.

### End-to-End Encryption Configuration for Clipboard Data:

When encryption is enabled, the clipboard data is encrypted on client devices. The server does not store this key, ensuring end-to-end encryption. The encryption password is generated using the user‚Äôs password, a salt, and the number of rounds, allowing you to control the **salt** and **number of rounds** used. This process creates a unique hashed password based on the specified salt and number of rounds.

However, it is crucial to use the same salt and number of rounds across all client devices. The default number of hash rounds is set to **664,937**, referred to as `hash_rounds`, while the default salt is set to empty, referred to as `salt`.

In the desktop application, you can find these fields in the **DATA** file located in the software's directory. On mobile devices, you can adjust these settings on the login page under **extra config**.

Before making any changes, ensure you log out and exit the application. After editing the `hash_rounds` or `salt` fields, log back in for the changes to take effect.

## ‚áÑ Reverse Proxy Setup

Here is a screenshot showing how to set up a reverse proxy using **Cloudflare Tunnels**. You can apply a similar approach with other providers as well.
